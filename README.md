<h1>MOVIE RECOMMENDER SYSTEM</h1>

Developed a movie recommender web app by using Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Python library (Streamlit)
Developed a machine learning model that classified user viewing behaviours and correlated them with relevant
content; this initiative resulted in a 30% reduction in content churn and markedly improved retention rates.


Key Highlights:

- Utilized collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations.
  Processed and analyzed a large dataset to extract meaningful insights using Pandas and NumPy.
- Implemented the recommendation engine using Python and Scikit-learn.
- Visualized data trends and patterns using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- This project not only strengthened my understanding of recommendation algorithms but also provided valuable experience in end-to-end project execution, from data preprocessing to model deployment.
